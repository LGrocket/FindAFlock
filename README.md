FindAFlock
==========
Product Overview: FindAFlock is building an application that connects nearby users to meetup for food, drinks or casual gatherings. A user begins by logging into the application using their Facebook account. Following the login, the user enters the home screen where the user can browse existing Flights or initiate a new Flight. In initiating a Flight, the user will broadcast a preference for food, drink or casual gathering, and will also select if the Flight will be shared by existing Facebook friends or by the general public as well. The user will then see a list of nearby Flights, ranked in order of proximity to the user. From this list, the user will be able to Soar with a Flight and Chirp with the Flock in order to make plans for an immediate interaction.
